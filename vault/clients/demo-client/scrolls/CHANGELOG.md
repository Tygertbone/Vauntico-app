# Changelog

All notable changes to the Vauntico Webhook Security System will be documented in this scroll.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### 🎉 Initial Release - The Sentinel Awakens

The first complete release of the Vauntico Webhook Security System. The MVP arc is sealed.

### Added

#### Security Core
- ⚔️ HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for webhook authenticity
- ⏰ Timestamp freshness validation with configurable tolerance (default 300s)
- ⚡ Constant-time string comparison to prevent timing attacks
- 🛡️ Comprehensive validation with detailed error reasons

#### Validation Logic
- `validateWebhook()` function with structured result types
- Support for `x-signature` and `x-timestamp` headers
- Configurable timestamp tolerance via `WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE`
- Six validation reason codes: VERIFIED, MISSING_SECRET, MISSING_SIGNATURE, MISSING_TIMESTAMP, INVALID_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT, TIMESTAMP_EXPIRED, SIGNATURE_MISMATCH

#### Signing Utilities
- `signWebhook()` for creating outgoing webhook signatures
- `createSignedRequest()` test helper for end-to-end validation
- Perfect symmetry between signing and validation logic

#### API Handler
- Example webhook handler with complete lifecycle
- Proper HTTP status code mapping for validation failures
- Event-based payload routing
- Audit logging integration points

#### React Components
- `WebhookAuditLog` - Displays validation history with visual hierarchy
- `WebhookStatusBadge` - Compact status indicator with icons
- Accessible, semantic HTML with ARIA labels
- Responsive design for all viewport sizes

#### Styling
- Minimalist CSS with semantic color coding
- Print-optimized styles for physical archives
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Dark mode compatible color palette

#### Testing
- Comprehensive unit test suite (16 tests)
- End-to-end integration tests (12 tests)
- Attack vector validation (replay, tampering, timing)
- >95% code coverage

#### Documentation
- Complete README with quick start guide
- SECURITY.md with threat model and best practices
- COMMIT_RITUAL.md for standardized commit messages
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md with architecture overview
- webhook-audit.md with example audit entries
- Inline code documentation with JSDoc comments

#### Examples
- Next.js API route integration (App Router + Pages Router)
- Webhook sending script with event types
- Express.js integration example
- Cloudflare Workers integration example

### Security Considerations

- ✅ Replay attack prevention through timestamp validation
- ✅ Timing attack resistance through constant-time comparison
- ✅ Message tampering detection through HMAC
- ✅ Configuration validation (fails closed if secret missing)
- ✅ No information leakage in error messages

### Known Limitations

- Requires shared secret (symmetric cryptography)
- Clock skew between sender/receiver must be within tolerance window
- Single secret per environment (no key rotation mechanism yet)

### Migration Notes

This is the initial release. No migration needed.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for v1.1.0

#### Features Under Consideration
- Database integration for persistent audit logs
- Webhook deduplication based on idempotency keys
- IP allowlisting support

- Webhook retry mechanism with exponential backoff

#### Security Enhancements
- JWT-based webhooks (asymmetric signatures)
- Webhook payload encryption
- Mutual TLS support
- Automatic secret rotation

#### Developer Experience
- CLI tool for local webhook testing
- Interactive signature verification playground
- VS Code extension with webhook snippets
- Webhook event generator for testing
