  "openingSignal": "Noise is the enemy of noticing.",
  "coreInsight": "Sometimes we create chaos not because life handed it to us, but because silence terrifies us more. The manufactured arguments, the scattered side projects, the endless scroll through other people's lives—these aren't accidents. They're strategies. Drama is a remarkably effective shield against feeling the thing you're most afraid to feel. But shields block light as effectively as they block blows. Every moment spent in manufactured noise is a moment you can't hear what your deeper self is trying to say. The wisdom you're searching for isn't hiding in the chaos. It's waiting in the quiet you keep running from.",
  "ritualPrompt": "Turn off one source of noise for 24 hours. Not forever—just one day. Notice what surfaces in the quiet. Don't judge it. Don't fix it. Just observe.",
  "closingSeal": "In silence, I see clearly."
