  "openingSignal": "The wound is not your enemy—it is your teacher.",
  "coreInsight": "For six days, you've been looking at the patterns. The productivity masks. The fortresses. The perfectionism and drama and achievement addiction. These aren't character flaws to be ashamed of. They're intelligent adaptations. They're signals, pointing to the exact places where healing wants to happen. To stop avoiding isn't to become weak—it's to become whole. To start listening isn't giving up control—it's reclaiming your power from the patterns that have been running you. This is where ascension begins: not in transcending your humanity, but in finally, courageously facing it.",
  "ritualPrompt": "Name one pattern you've noticed this week. Say it out loud or write it down. Then whisper to it, like you're greeting an old friend: 'I see you. Thank you for protecting me. I'm ready to learn what you came to teach.'",
  "closingSeal": "Awareness is the first ascension."
