  "openingSignal": "Every fortress hides a fracture.",
  "coreInsight": "Behind every over-engineered system, every backup plan for your backup plan, lives a singular fear: that you'll be caught unprepared when everything falls apart. You don't build fortresses because you love complexity. You build them because somewhere, sometime, you learned that being vulnerable meant being unsafe. But here's the truth most founders won't admit: the fortress itself has become the trap. The very systems meant to protect you are now the walls keeping you confined. The wound isn't in your infrastructureâ€”it's in the story you keep telling yourself about what safety requires.",
  "ritualPrompt": "Ask yourself: What am I really protecting myself from? Sit with the answer until it stops being abstract and starts being true.",
  "closingSeal": "I am safe enough to simplify."
