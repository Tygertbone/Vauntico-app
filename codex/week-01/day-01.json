  "openingSignal": "Busy is not the same as alive.",
  "coreInsight": "Many founders mistake constant motion for progress. But motion without meaning is just avoidance wearing a badge of honor. The inbox, the endless tweaks, the late-night grind—these aren't proof of your commitment. They're barriers between you and the question that terrifies you most: Why am I really building this? True work begins when you stop hiding behind tasks and start facing what you're here to create. Not what looks impressive. Not what checks the boxes. What calls to you—the work that would still matter even if no one was watching.",
  "ritualPrompt": "Write down one task you've been doing that makes you feel productive but doesn't move your soul forward. Be honest. No one is watching.",
  "closingSeal": "I choose meaning over motion."
