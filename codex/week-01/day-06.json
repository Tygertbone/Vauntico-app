  "openingSignal": "Success can be the sweetest anesthetic.",
  "coreInsight": "The wins pile up. The metrics climb. The validation arrives. And still, somehow, the emptiness remains. That's because trophies don't heal woundsâ€”they just distract from them temporarily. Achievement is a painkiller, not a cure. The applause fades, the high wears off, and the wound that was there before success arrived is still there, still waiting, still asking to be acknowledged. This isn't about abandoning ambition. It's about understanding what you're really chasing. Are you building something meaningful, or are you just running fast enough to stay ahead of what hurts?",
  "ritualPrompt": "Write down your last big 'win.' Celebrate it genuinely. Then ask yourself: What pain did I secretly hope this would erase? What was I trying to prove, and to whom?",
  "closingSeal": "I am more than my victories."
