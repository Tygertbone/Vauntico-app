  "title": "The Weight of Perfection",
  "openingSignal": "Perfection is the slowest form of avoidance.",
  "coreInsight": "The endless polishing. The one-more-round of refinements. The just-needs-a-little-more-work-before-launch. This isn't excellence speakingâ€”it's fear. Fear of judgment, of criticism, of being seen as less-than. Perfection promises safety from scrutiny, but what it actually delivers is safety from living. Every day you delay is a day you choose the comfort of control over the risk of connection. The work doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be real. It needs to exist in the world, breathing and imperfect, so it can finally do what it came here to do.",
  "ritualPrompt": "Release one unfinished thing into the world today. A message, a draft, an idea. Let it breathe, imperfect and alive. Notice what happens inside you when you do.",
  "closingSeal": "Done is sacred."
