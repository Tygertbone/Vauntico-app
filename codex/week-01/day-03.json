  "openingSignal": "Every error is a mirror.",
  "coreInsight": "Debugging isn't punishment—it's revelation. Each bug shows you exactly where your assumptions broke down, where reality diverged from your mental model. The best founders know this. They treat errors as intelligence, not insults. Life works the same way. The recurring arguments, the pattern of failures, the opportunities that somehow always slip through your fingers—these aren't random glitches in your story. They're diagnostic messages pointing to exactly where your code needs rewriting. Not your codebase. Your beliefs. Your behaviors. Your defenses.",
  "ritualPrompt": "Think of one 'bug' in your life right now. Instead of rushing to fix it, pause and ask: What is this trying to teach me? What assumption of mine is breaking down?",
  "closingSeal": "Every error carries wisdom."
