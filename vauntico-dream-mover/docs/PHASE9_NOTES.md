# Phase 9 Notes

Acceptance:
- API portal serves stub endpoints for /sim, /manifest, /rune-infuse; CLI api-serve; Swagger spec present.
- Cron rite schedules an infusion by writing cron-schedule.json; CLI cron-rite writes schedule; web panels show exact CLIs.
- Warp entry: Phase 9 Portal & Pulse starts API (background job) and writes a schedule.
