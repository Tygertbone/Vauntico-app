# Phase 3 Notes

Acceptance:
- Driver parity: NodeFsDriver offers OS-appropriate links and permission checks
- CLI simulate: riskScore refined, collisionPreview written to logs/collision-preview.json and manifest
- Web: Mermaid ShadowViewer renders /dm-logs/shadow-map.mmd; AuditSummary shows risk doughnut
- Warp: Phase 3 Render workflow entry
- Tests: driver parity + refined risks pass
