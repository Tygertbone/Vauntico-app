# Phase 6 Notes

Acceptance:
- Rust bridge gated by DM_USE_RUST with tier gating in CLI; logs availability; no side-effect native ops in POC.
- Compliance rune weaver infuses GDPR/HIPAA templates into plans; CLI rune-infuse command.
- Web ComplianceWizard suggests exact CLI for infusion; Marketplace vet recognizes compliance presence.
- Warp entry: Phase 6 Bridge & Runes (db-relocation + GDPR infusion).
