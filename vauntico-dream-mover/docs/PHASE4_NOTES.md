# Phase 4 Notes

Acceptance:
- Rust core seed exists (crate + exported function) and optional rust bridge tries to load via env;
- CLI simulate supports --use-rust flag and logs availability without side effects;
- Marketplace vetter flags risky plans and passes certified ones; CI posts vet issues on PR;
- Warp entry: Vet & Rust POC to demo docker-volumes vet + simulate with --use-rust.
