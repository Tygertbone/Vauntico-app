# Dream Mover • Hybrid Manifesto

Migrate with ceremony. Rollback with confidence.

- Grok’s Ritual Empire: whimsical UX—shadow maps, reflective prompts, adaptive dry-runs, AI-suggested plans.
- Claude’s Professional Platform: enterprise pillars—web dashboard, marketplace, compliance templates, phased GTM.

Tenets
- Ritual over script: simulate → migrate → rollback.
- Safety by default: dryRun first, verifyMode explicit, time capsules for restore.
- Auditable by design: per-item manifests, immutable logs, CI plan validation.
- Teach-as-you-move: explain decisions, show risk, let users learn.
