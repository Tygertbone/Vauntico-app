# Phase 20 — Eternal End (Final MVP Polish + Launch Eternal)

This phase finalizes the MVP with full i18n polish and an eternal launch chain that combines onboarding and viral sharing. All actions remain dry‑run safe.

Highlights
- Polish MVP: polish-mvp writes logs/polish-mvp.json with DM_POLISH=true and full i18n dict (en/af).
- Eternal launch: eternal-launch appends to cosmic-close.yml and writes logs/eternal-launch.yml.
- Web: MVPPolisher and EternalEnder added and wired into the dashboard.
- Warp: “Phase 20 End & Eternal” workflow chaining polish → launch.
- CI: jest polish-eternal covering outputs.

Quick demo
- Polish MVP:
  node vauntico-dream-mover/dist/cli.js polish-mvp --config beta
- Eternal launch (C:→D:, viral X):
  node vauntico-dream-mover/dist/cli.js eternal-launch --blitz C:D: --viral x

Notes
- i18n dict is stubbed for en/af and can be expanded via i18next later.
- Live APIs remain behind offline stubs for safety.
