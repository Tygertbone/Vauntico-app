\*\*Tool:\*\* `vauntico-purifier` — The Mythic JSX Restoration Engine



\### ✨ Summary



This release marks the completion of Vauntico’s first full purification cycle. Over 80 components and pages were scanned, healed, and blessed using the internal CLI tool `vauntico-purifier`.



\### 🔧 Fixes \& Restorations



\- ✅ Truncated exports repaired  

\- ✅ JSX outside return blocks relocated  

\- ✅ Misaligned props normalized  

\- ✅ Unclosed tags sealed  

\- ✅ Corruption map generated for CI visibility



\### 📜 Ritual Notes



> “From corruption comes clarity. From chaos comes code.”



This ritual was run manually via PowerShell, without Warp or Cursor, using pure founder grit and Manus CLI. It represents Vauntico’s resilience and sovereignty.



\### 🛠️ Next Steps



\- Merge into `main` once CI passes  

\- Expose the purifier via `/brand` or `/rituals`  

\- Prepare onboarding docs and lore drop
